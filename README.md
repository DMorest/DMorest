### HELLO FRIEND!
Welcome here! Hmmm... Dunno what to say here, but, it's kinda lucky for me to have you visiting this little 
and 80%-blank page. 
🎉I have a bilibili account which have some bad videos. 'Cause I don't really
have lots of fans, so my update counts on my feeling. If you wanna watch more
good videos, go&subscribe me to let me know~

### What you may find
I love cool things related to computers. I use Python(PyCharm), VS and Dev-C++.
If I find something really easy to do and it's cool, I'll submit the code 
here.
I also make games. I may sometimes send my demos here.
😢My coding experience is kinda poor. If you're a big pro, then it's too
lucky for me to meet you! You can leave messages for me! XD
### ADVERTISMENT
Eh, through it may look fake, but I would still like to thank @Mr_DZT for
being together with me on the net. Also go and sub him on bilibili~😘
